# bigtifcutter
在深度学习的预处理阶段，遇到多通道大的tif文件时就会头大。普通的绘图软件打不开，PIL有限制，3通道以上直接报错。于是整理开发了本项目用于切割大的tif文件，派上用场的话请给个star吧。
目前是demo版本，参数请自行配置，年后更新
In the pre-processing phase of deep learning, when you encounter a tif file with a large number of channels, you will have a large head. Ordinary drawing software can not be opened, PIL has restrictions, more than 3 channels directly report errors. Therefore, I organized and developed this project for cutting large tif files. Please give me a star if it comes in handy.
The current version is demo. Set your own parameters and update them after the next year
